## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tfl_api_client'
```

And then install via bundler:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tfl_api_client


### Supported Ruby Versions

The TFL API Client supports Ruby 2.0.0 or higher. 


## Usage

TFL API Client has been designed to be as simple as possible to work with.

To use the TFL API, developers should [register][tfl_registration] for a set
of API credentials (an Application ID and Application Key).

Once valid API credentials have been obtained, you will need to pass the 
Application ID and Application Key upon initialisation of the client:

```ruby
@client = TflApi::Client.new(app_id: TFL_APP_ID, app_key: TFL_APP_KEY)
````

In addition to the above mandatory parameters, a number of optional parameters
can be passed:

| Option       | Default Value          | Description                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| host         | https://api.tfl.gov.uk | TFL API's host url                                  |
| logger       | a new Logger instance  | Logger object to log into                           |
| log_level    | INFO                   | The log level to logging at                         |
| log_location | STDOUT                 | Location to send all logs (can be a file or STDOUT) |

* by suggesting [new features][issues]
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing code ( **no patch is too small** : fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace )
* by refactoring code
* by reviewing code
